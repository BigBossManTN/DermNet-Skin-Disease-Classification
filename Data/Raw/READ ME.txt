Project Description:

This project focuses on classifying skin disease images into multiple categories using deep learning. 
The dataset contains real medical images grouped into folders, where each folder represents a specific 
skin condition. The goal is to build a model that can identify the correct disease class from an input 
image. This type of system can support early screening and help medical professionals or users get a 
quick first-level suggestion before consulting a dermatologist.

Problem Definition:

The objective of this project is to classify skin images into one of the multiple disease categories 
provided in the dataset. Each image belongs to a single class such as acne, eczema, psoriasis, fungal 
infections, or other skin conditions.

This is a multi-class image classification problem, where the target variable is the disease label 
determined by the folder name.

Two models were developed:
- A baseline CNN model trained from scratch.
- A pretrained MobileNetV2 model using transfer learning.

The pretrained model produced better results due to stronger feature extraction and better generalization.

The model’s performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and the classification report 
(precision, recall and F1-score).
