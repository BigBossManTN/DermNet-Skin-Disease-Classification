# Skin Disease Dataset - Data Dictionary

## Dataset Overview
The dataset is organized into two main folders:
- train/
- test/

Each folder contains multiple subfolders. Each subfolder represents one skin disease class.
Every image inside a folder belongs to that class.

Images are RGB and are resized to 224x224 during model preprocessing.

(If you want, we can add the test set counts too.)

## Target
- The target label is the folder name of the image (multi-class problem).

## Notes
- Dataset is heavily imbalanced (some classes have more than 300 images, some only 50).
- Images vary in resolution, lighting and background.
- No processed images are saved to disk; preprocessing is done dynamically using ImageDataGenerator.
