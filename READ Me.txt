# Skin Disease Image Classification Project

This project uses a multi-class skin disease dataset (DermNet) to build two models:
a baseline CNN and a pretrained MobileNetV2 model. The goal is to classify images
into different skin disease categories and compare the performance of both models.

## Dataset
- Source: DermNet (Kaggle)
- Structure: train/ and test/ folders
- Each folder contains multiple class folders (acne, eczema, etc.)
- Images vary in size, lighting and texture
- Multi-class classification problem with 3+ classes

## Objective
Build and compare:
1. A simple CNN model (baseline)
2. A pretrained MobileNetV2 model (transfer learning)

Select the best performing model and evaluate it on the final test set.

## Project Structure


## Main Steps

- Dataset overview and structure
- EDA with sample images and class distribution
- Baseline CNN model
- Pretrained MobileNetV2 model
- Evaluation (confusion matrix, classification report)
- Error analysis
- Final model selected and saved

## Results Summary

- The baseline CNN underperformed due to limited capacity
- MobileNetV2 achieved better accuracy and generalization
- Pretrained model was selected as the final model

## Final Model
Saved at:
`models/final_skin_disease_model.keras`

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- pillow
- numpy
